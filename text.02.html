    <h1>Documentary Note on Ertuğrul</h1>
  <hr>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Ertuğrul Gazi was a prominent Turkish leader in the 13th century, best known as the father of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire. 
    Though limited historical records exist about him, his life has been romanticized and dramatized in recent years, especially through 
    the popular Turkish television series <em>Diriliş: Ertuğrul</em>. He is admired as a brave warrior, a loyal leader, and a devout Muslim who upheld justice and moral values.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ertuğrul’s legacy has grown to symbolize the spirit of resistance and the beginning of a vast Islamic empire that would last over 600 years. 
    His character reflects not just physical strength, but wisdom, piety, and a deep sense of justice that laid the foundation for future generations.

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    Ertuğrul was born into the Kayı tribe, one of the 24 Oghuz Turkic tribes. During a period of chaos and migration caused by the Mongol invasions, 
    he led his tribe westward into Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), which was under the rule of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to historical accounts, Ertuğrul came to the aid of the Seljuks during a critical battle against the Byzantines. 
    As a reward for his bravery and support, the Seljuk Sultan granted him lands near the Byzantine frontier. This territory later 
    became the base for the rise of the Ottoman Empire under his son, Osman.

  <h2>Battles</h2>
  <p>
    Though concrete historical records are scarce, Ertuğrul is believed to have participated in several key battles against the Byzantines and 
    possibly the Mongols. His tactical skills and courage on the battlefield earned him a reputation as a powerful and reliable military leader.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many of these conflicts were part of the wider struggle to defend Muslim lands from invading forces and to expand Turkish control into Byzantine territories. 
    His military success allowed his tribe to settle safely in Söğüt, a strategic location that would later become the heart of the Ottoman state.

  <h2>Achievements</h2>
  <p>
    One of Ertuğrul’s greatest achievements was establishing a strong and stable tribal leadership that would enable the formation of an empire. 
    He united various Turkic groups, upheld justice, and ensured the survival of his people during times of war and displacement.
  </p>
  <p>
    He is remembered not only for his leadership in battle but for his ethical governance, sense of duty, and promotion of Islamic teachings. 
    Ertuğrul's tomb in Söğüt remains a place of respect and visitation, and his legacy continues to inspire millions of people across the world.
